Review/Refresher of Linked Lists

Create a linked list class with the following methods:

    constructor
    push_front
    push_back
    pop_front
    pop_back
    insert_in_order
    size
    print_all (for debugging purposes)

This should be a templated class (let's call the template variable E).  So we will have:

    void push_front (E item)
    void push_back(E item)
    void insert_in_order(E item) - inserts item in it's proper order in the linked list
    E pop_front()
    E pop_back()
    int size()
    void print_all()

Attack this in pieces.  First implement the constructor, push_front, and print_all.  Get them working BEFORE you even THINK about the implementation of the other methods.
